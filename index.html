                  <br>
                  <p>"In my experience with Elias he proved to be one of the best QA Analyst that I've ever teamed with, and I truly hope to get to work with him again in the future.

                      I worked with him from his day one at Globant as Tester, he showed true potential from the start.
                      On my first project with him he was the MVP of the team, he has a keen eye for detail, and technical knowledge that allow him to find defects both ensuring proper handling or edge/stress cases, as well a polished look and feel.
                      After moving to a new project I hand picked Elias to work for EA Canada and Bioware, in 'QA Analyst' role with new tasks and responsibilities. He excelled again, not only as tester/bug finder, but as an analyst, getting involved in test planning and proving valuable and constructive feedback to the client and his management.
                      
                      He is very dedicated to his work, committed to his team and project, always looking to improve.
                      He's relentless, will ask for answer (or help) until he gets it."</p>

          <p>Apart from being a Quality Assurance Engineer, I enjoy most of my time being musician. I play bass guitar on a couple of bands, love (really love) the winter and certainly cannot exist without coffee.</p>
          <p class="mb-0">When forced indoors, I follow a number of sci-fi and fantasy genre movies and television shows and I spend a large amount of my free time exploring the latest technology advancements in the Quality Assurance and web development world. Even though I never worked as a Front-End developer (so far) I'm constantly learning about that line of work and their technologies since it helps me a lot to plan better quality processes. </p>
